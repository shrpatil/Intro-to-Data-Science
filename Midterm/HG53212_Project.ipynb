    "This is the open-source dataset for the Open Brewery DB API which is served by a REST API built with Ruby on Rails. Retrieved from https://github.com/openbrewerydb/openbrewerydb\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset represents the data about breweries in the United states, Ireland and United Kingdom. It has 7984 rows and 16 columns. Some of the columns are brewery id, name, brewery type, street address, city, state, country, website URL. I am interested in this data because I like Exploring beers. It has a huge diversity of beer styles, taste profiles and in the future as a business opportunity I would like to invest in this industry.\n",

    "__Introduction__\n",
    "\n",
    "Beer is an alcoholic beverage produced by extracting raw materials with water, boiling with hops, and fermenting it. Beer brewing procedure has a cultural history behind it. In the 21st century the brewing industry has become large-scale with the use of technology. Brewery industry has grown so much that it has a significant contribution to the economic growth of the nation. America’s beer industry supports more than two million jobs, provides more than 102 billion dollor in wages and benefits, and contributes more than 331 billion dollor to the U.S. economy. These stats made me choose this dataset for the analysis. In this project I will try to get a generalized idea of how the brewery industry is distributed over the USA based on the given data.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are distinct beer industry market segments.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Large-  A brewery that produces Approximately 2 million barrels of beer per year.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Regional-  A brewery with an annual beer production of between 15,000 and 2,000,000 barrels.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Microbrewery- A brewery that produces less than 15,000 barrels of beer per year and sells 75 percent or more of its beer off-site.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Brewpub-  A restaurant-brewer that sells 25 percent or more of its beer on-site and operates significant food services.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Taproom-  A professional brewery that sells 25 percent or more of its beer on-site and does not operate significant food services.The beer is brewed primarily for sale in the taproom, and is often dispensed directly from the brewery’s storage tanks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Contract-  A business that hires another brewery to produce its beer.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Proprietary-  A licensed tenant brewery that physically takes possession of a shared brewery while brewing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Nano-  A brewery which produces at least 1,000 barrels per year.(1/3 to 1/10th the size of a microbrewery)\n",
    "\n",
    "__Objectives__\n",
    "\n",
    "- To discover which type of brewery is popular\n",
    "- To discover which location in the USA has potential for the brewery industry.\n",
    "- To understand the overall industry insights."

    "### What we learned ?\n",
    "\n",
    "1] Ballast Point Brewing Company has the highest number of franchisees in craft breweries. Mostly they are in California.\n",
    "\n",
    "2] In Bend, Oregon there is a hub of breweries. There are large and regional breweries located in the postal code – 97701 area.\n",
    "\n",
    "3] Portland, Denver, San Diego, Seattle and Chicago are the top five cities which have the highest number of breweries.\n",
    "\n",
    "4] Portland has the greatest number of micro and brewpub types of breweries. Further analysis found, since the 80s, Portland is pioneering the craft beer movement with fresh ingredients like Willamette Valley hops and Bull Run water. City has a nickname “Beervana” due to its vast range of beer industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "5] There is a correlation between the number of breweries and states. We can see that mostly breweries are popular in states California, Washington, Colorado, New York and Michigan.\n",
    "\n",
    "6] Profitable locations of breweries defer based on which type of beer you want to make. Micro-breweries mostly make craft beers which they sell on-site also, whereas large breweries rarely sell cell beers on-site. San Diego is good for large breweries and Portland is a good choice for micro-breweries."
